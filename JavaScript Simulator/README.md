# Path Planning Simulator
This folder includes the Javasript based simulator. The following algorithms are being simulated in this implementation:
1. Breadth First Search
2. Depth First Search
3. Greedy Best First Search
4. Dijkstra's Algorithm
5. A-Star Algorithm
6. Rapidly Exploring Random Trees (RRT)
7. RRT - Connect
8. RRT - Star

To use the simulator, clone the repository to your computer and launch index.html which contains the web interface. The source file is located in the scripts folder.
